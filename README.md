Varnish for ATLAS

Varnish is a reverse http proxy. It is meant to cache accesses to one application/server. For this purpose it is sufficient to use RAM for caching.

We support use of Varnish for Frontier accesses and for CVMFS accesses. Instructions and code for the Frontier accesses can be found in branch [frontier-no-cvmfs](https://github.com/ivukotic/v4A/tree/frontier-no-cvmfs), while instructions for CVMFS accesses are in [cvmfs-no-cvmfs](https://github.com/ivukotic/v4A/tree/cvmfs-no-cvmfs).
